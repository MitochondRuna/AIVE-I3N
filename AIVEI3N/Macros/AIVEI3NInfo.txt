This plugin contains the AIVE image processing macros specific to the I3N project.

// Split Core B Macro
The Split Core B button runs a macro that automatically detects and splits
the output of the AIVE Core B macro into classes. This is useful for training
the machine learning model to detect membranes.

// CLAHE PreFilter Macro
The CLAHE PreFilter performs a light noise reduction strategy across the FIB-SEM
image stack prior to the CLAHE macro. This can help reduce the impact of noise 
during the CLAHE adjustment.

// AIVE I3N merge Macro
The AIVE I3N merge is different from the original AIVE merge.
This macro requires 4 inputs to run:

- The Membrane prediction output from the Core B macro, or equivalent model result
- The "Source" image, which has been PreFiltered and run through the 3D CLAHE
- The binary object/class split results from AIVE Macro 1,
    (as a folder of individual binary tif stacks per object)
- The combined binary result of all objects as a single tif image stack
